# MathQuill + Leptos = ❤️
A simple, easy-to-use and hard to abuse API for using MathQuill in Leptos.
Is only really tested using CSR (Client Side Rendering), although it shouldn't
cause issues with SSR.

## Running examples
```nushell
# install trunk however you like
cargo install trunk

trunk serve --example field
trunk serve --example static
```
