You need to load the JQuery JS library and the MathQuill JS library before using this crate,
download from [their github releases page](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill/releases/latest)
and a copy of jQuery (e.g. [here](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js)).
You will then need to include `<script>` tags to load them.
See [the MathQuill documentation](https://docs.mathquill.com/en/latest/Getting_Started/) for more details
