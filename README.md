## YMap
This is the fourth attempt at implementing this.
As always, this is a **100% Rust** project, and I want to prove that Rust is good at everything.

I might write more about the grandiuos ideas I have, but at the moment the scope this project is aiming four is:
- [x] Client side rendered webpage ...
- [] ... that shows autogenerated math questions and their solutions ...
- [] ... and allows people to add templates of math questions ...
- [] ... and allows for adding/seeing generic thoughts.

Also parallel to this:
- [] A note taking app (using tauri to render the webpage, SPA) ...
- [] ... that allows tagging note pages ...
- [] ... and allows viewing two different views at once ...
- [] ... and supports the custom apple pen double tap on iOS ...
- [] ... that is published on the App Store (way in the future)
